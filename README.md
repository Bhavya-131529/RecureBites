# RecureBites
Smart Leftover Logistics is a food-rescue platform that helps supermarkets and bakeries reduce waste by tracking daily surplus and connecting it to NGOs or nearby customers. It automates pickups, enables discounted sales, and ensures edible food is redistributed sustainably instead of being thrown away.
